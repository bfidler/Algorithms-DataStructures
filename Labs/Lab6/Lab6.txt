3. Static members do not depend on the object of the class, so static members
	are the same for either derived class

4.the function can be overidden by derived classes and called by whatever
	dynamic type the node is

5. It's a reference to a new value in that leaf. If it returns nullptr, nothing
	happens to new key.

6. The while loop finds the position that the item will go into, then the item
	will be inserted into the child. A reference to that is returned to split.
	If that reference is not nullptr, then the item will be moved down the tree.

7. Dump is called on the root which has no depth and therefore won't need to be
	idented whether it's an internal node or a leaf

8. It's bad because it has no comments, allows duplicates, and prints out values
	in more than one level. It's good because all the values in the tree are 
	present in the leaves.
